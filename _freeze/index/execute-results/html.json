The Tidyverse is a veritable universe of tools though that no single workshop could hope to cover so **we are focusing here on an introductory approach that focuses primarily on some fundamentals to tidying data in R**. We are always happy to improve workshop content so please don't hesitate to [post an Issue](https://github.com/lter/workshop-tidyverse/issues) on our GitHub repository if you see clear areas for improvement!\n\n<img src=\"images/logos/hex_tidyverse.png\" alt=\"Hex logo for the Tidyverse R package\" align=\"right\" width=\"17%\" />\n\nTo maximize the value of this workshop to you, we recommend that you take the following steps **before the day of the workshop**. If anything is unclear, feel free to reach out to us; our contact information can be found [here](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/staff.html)\n\n## Workshop Preparation\n\n**For those of you with a dedicated IT team that has sole power to install software on your computer**: you may need to contact them before the workshop to do the installation bits of the prep steps we outline below.\n\n### 1. Install R\n\nInstall [R](https://www.r-project.org/). If you already have R, check that you have at least version 4.0.0 by running the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nversion$version.string\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf your version starts with a 3 (e.g., the above code returns \"R version 3...\"), please update R to make sure all packages behave as expected.\n\n### 2. Install RStudio\n\nOnce you have R (ver. ≥4.0), install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). If you already have RStudio installed, you may want to make sure that you're using a recent version to take advantage of some quality of life improvements that are broadly useful.\n\n### 3. Install Some R Packages\n\n**Install the `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins` R packages** using the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"librarian\")\nlibrarian::shelf(tidyverse, palmerpenguins)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Please run the above code even if you already have these packages** to update these packages and ensure that your code aligns with the examples and challenges introduced during the workshop.\n\n### 4. Celebrate!\n\nAfter following all the previous preparation steps, your setup should now be complete.\n\n## Example Data - Penguins\n\nThe data we'll be using for this workshop comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, maintained by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/). The \"penguins\" dataset from this package contains size measurements for adult foraging penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program. Let's take a look at it!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 344 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   <fct>   <fct>              <dbl>         <dbl>             <int>       <int>\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA          NA\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8               181        3625\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6               195        4675\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1               193        3475\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           42            20.2               190        4250\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex <fct>, year <int>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe \"penguins\" dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns.\n\nThe columns are as follows:\n\n- `species`: a factor denoting penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo)\n- `island`: a factor denoting island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (Biscoe, Dream or Torgersen)\n- `bill_length_mm`: a number denoting bill length (millimeters)\n- `bill_depth_mm`: a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)\n- `flipper_length_mm`: an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters)\n- `body_mass_g`: an integer denoting body mass (grams)\n- `sex`: a factor denoting penguin sex (female, male)\n- `year`: an integer denoting the study year (2007, 2008, or 2009)\n\nThis dataset is an example of **tidy data**, which means that each **variable** is in its own **column** and each **observation** is in its own **row**. Generally speaking, functions from packages in the Tidyverse expect tidy data though they can be used in some cases to help get data into tidy format! Regardless, the penguins dataset is what we'll use for all examples in this workshop so be sure that you install the `palmerpenguins` R package. The examples on this page were adapted from [Allison Horst's `dplyr` tutorial](https://allisonhorst.shinyapps.io/dplyr-learnr/#section-welcome)!\n\n## Websites to Visit\n\n### Supplemental Material\n\nWhile not technically necessary to attend the workshop, if you'd like you can see the content that created the workshop website you are viewing by visiting our [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/lter/workshop-tidyverse).\n\nAlso, check out **NCEAS' [Learning Hub](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/learning-hub)** for a complete list of workshops and trainings offered by NCEAS.\n",

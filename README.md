# LTER Scientific Computing Workshop - Coding in R's Tidyverse

## Repository Explanation

For teams that code using the R programming language, the most familiar tools are often part of "base R" meaning that those functions and packages come pre-loaded when R is installed. Relatively recently the Tidyverse has emerged as a comprehensive suite of packages that can complement base R or serve as an alternative for some tasks. This includes packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` as well as the perhaps infamous pipe operator (`%>%`) among many other tools. This workshop is aimed at helping participants use the Tidyverse equivalents of fundamental data wrangling tasks that learners may be used to performing with base R.
